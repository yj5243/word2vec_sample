As an example we’ll use the domain of searching for restaurants. We’ll start with an extremely simple model of those conversations. You can build up from there.
Let’s assume that anything our bot’s users say can be categorized into one of the following intents:
greet
restaurant_search
thankyou
Of course there are many ways our users might greet our bot:
Hi!
Hey there!
Hello again :)
And even more ways to say that you want to look for restaurants:
Do you know any good pizza places?
I’m in the North of town and I want chinese food
I’m hungry
The first job of rasa NLU is to assign any given sentence to one of the intent categories: greet, restaurant_search, or thankyou.
The second job is to label words like “Mexican” and “center” as cuisine and location entities, respectively. In this tutorial we’ll build a model which does exactly that.
Preparing the Training Data
The training data is essential to develop chatbots. It should include texts to be interpreted and the structured data (intent/entities) we expect chatbots to convert the texts into. The best way to get training texts is from real users, and the best way to get the structured data is to pret
